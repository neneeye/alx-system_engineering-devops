# Postmortem
The following is the incident report for an isolated Ubuntu 14.04 container running an Apache
Web Server on Feburary 14, 2021. GET requests on the server led to 500 Internal Server Error when an
HTML page was expected.

## Issue Summary
From 6:26 PM to 7:58 PM WAT, requests to the Apache Web server resulted in 500 error response
messages. All services that relied on this server also returned errors. At its peak, the issue
affected 100% of traffic to this Server. The root cause of this error was an incorrectly typed file
name``(class-wp-locale.phpp)`` which was meant to be class-wp-locale.php (Was surprised to see such a rooky mistake)

## Timeline (all times West African Time)
+ 6:19PM: Server Configuration
+ 6:20PM: Error on request, noticed by engineer (I thought I would loose my job)
+ 6:20PM: Engineer first checked running processes with ``ps aux``
+ 6:22PM: Confirmed that web server was serving content from ``/var/www/html/`` folder
+ 6:25PM: Ran strace on the PID of root Apache process while curling server on another instance
+ 6:54PM: Ran starce on the PID of www-data process which showed where error origin
+ 6:58PM: Looked through all files in ``/var/www/html/`` to locate file containing error
+ 7:15PM: Successful error debugging and application of changes by removing trailing p
+ 7:18PM: Tested server by curling in another instance (My dream car is still secured :)
+ 7:21PM: Server restarts begin
+ 7:30PM: Wrote Puppet manifest to automate fixing the error.
+ 7:58PM: 100% of traffic back online

## Root Cause
At 6:19PM WAT, a configuration change was inadvertently released to our production
environment without first being released to the testing environment. The change contained
a typo with an incorrectly typed file name. The WordPress app was encountering a critical
error in wp-settings.php when ntrying to load the file ``class-wp-locale.phpp``.
The correct file name, located in the wp-content directory of the application folder, was
``class-wp-locale.php``. This lead to the 500 Internal Server Error received on request to the page.

## Resolution and recovery
At 6:20 PM WAT, an engineers noticed the issue and quickly began debugging.
By 7:15 PM, the bug was found and fixed.
The processes running on the server was fisrt checked. The strace (a very effective debugging tool)
was used to trace out bugs in the process. At 6:58PM PM, all files served by the web server was 
searched by matching pattern to try and locate the erroneous ``.phpp`` file
extension. By 7:19 PM, server was confirmed to be serving the correct content

## Corrective and Preventative Measures
In the last two days, weâ€™ve conducted an internal review and analysis of the outage.
The following are actions we are taking to address the underlying causes of the issue and
to help prevent recurrence and improve response times:
Test the application before deploying. The bug could have been fixed if the entire process had been tested.
Change rollback process to be quicker and more robust.
Improve process for auditing all high-risk configuration options.
Add a faster rollback mechanism and improve the traffic ramp-up process, so any future
problems of this type can be corrected quickly.
Develop better mechanism for quickly delivering status notifications during incidents.
A Puppet manifest was written to automate fixing of the error should it occur in the future.
